    "To perform a piece of music, one could have a single musician playing many notes at once (for example a pianist, or many musicians playing one note each (for example a string quartet). Similarly, to perform a parallel task on a modern computer, one could have a single instance of a program do many things at once, or have many copies of a program do one thing each. In more exact language, task parallelism on a multi-processor computing system can be multi-threaded or multi-process.\n",

    "Each version has its own advantages, and which version is best (or whether to combine both!) depends on the nature of the problem to be solved. Threads are lightweight, which make them cheap to create and destroy. They also share resources including program memory, which makes communication between them cheap. However this also requires thought to ensure that two threads don't modify the same piece of memory at the same time. Processes are larger, and thus more expensive to create temporarily, Communication is also more involved. However, there is no reason processes need to run on the same machine to be able to communicate, so multiprocessing works well at the scale of computer clusters, particularly if the problem being worked on divides naturally into independent parts.\n",

    "### Writing parallel algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all problems parallelise easily. if each step in a problem depends explictly and nonlinearly on the one before, then it is likely to be hard to divide the workload. Similarly, some problems are \"embarassingly parallel\", where a single set of operations needs to be performed on all the elements of an array of data. This is precisely the form of problem which is great to pass to a GPU hardware accelerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syncronous versus Asyncronous computation\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as a code inteacts with an external process, it can operate in two different modes, a synchrous one, where the call waits each time for the operation to return its result before continuing, or an asyncronous one, in which  the original process continues, perhaps checking back later to collect a result. Jobs which absolutely require waiting for them are called \"blocking\", while jobs which never need to be waited for are called \"non-blocking\". Modern Python 3 contains keywords `async`, to declare a function as asyncronous, and `await` to block for a call and collect final results. A useful builtin module, `asyncio`, gives us some more control over the running of these processes."

This philiosophy is termed \"lazy\" evaluation, with the opposite standpoint, in which all expressions are evaluated immediately is called \"eager\" evaluation"

    "- Why is the multiprocessing scheduler so much slower here?\n",

    "The `threaded` scheduler is a fine choice for working with large datasets out-of-core on a single machine, as long as the functions being used release the [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock) most of the time. NumPy and pandas release the GIL in most places, so the `threaded` scheduler is the default for `dask.array` and `dask.dataframe`. The distributed scheduler, perhaps with `processes=False`, will also work well for these workloads on a single machine.\n",

    "For workloads that do hold the GIL, as is common with `dask.bag` and custom code wrapped with `dask.delayed`, we recommend using the distributed scheduler, even on a single machine. Generally speaking, it's more intelligent and provides better diagnostics than the `processes` scheduler.\n",
