    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating-point arithmetic is ubiquitous in computer systems. Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on those aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, and concludes with a discussion of the IEEE floating-point standard."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Scientists often need information about floating-point arithmetic. This is a tutorial on those aspects of floating-point arithmetic (*floating-point* hereafter) that have a direct connection to computational software development. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we will consider *rounding error* and discuss the implications of using different rounding strategies for the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We will also consider two methods of measuring rounding error, `ulps` and `relative error`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we will discuss the IEEE-754 floating-point standard and the rounding method for basic operations."

    "## Rounding Error\n",
    "\n",
    "Squeezing infinitely many real numbers into a finite number of bits requires an approximate representation. Although there are infinitely many integers, in most programs the result of integer computations can be stored in 32 bits (`int`). In contrast, given any fixed number of bits, most calculations with real numbers will produce quantities that cannot be exactly represented using a finite number of bits. Therefore the result of a floating-point calculation must often be rounded in order to fit back into its finite representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rounding error is the characteristic feature of floating-point computation. It needs to be understood by computational scientists as under certain conditions these errors can be detrimental to the computed solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IEEE-754 floating-point was introduced to standardize algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root, and requires that implementations produce the same result as that algorithm. Thus, when software is executed on different computers supporting IEEE-754, the results of the basic operations will be identical. This greatly simplifies the development and porting of software across different computing platforms."

    "There are two reasons why a real number might not be exactly representable as a floating-point number. The most common situation is illustrated by the decimal number $0.1$. Although it has a finite decimal representation, in binary it has an infinite repeating representation. Thus when $\\beta = 2$, the number $0.1$ lies strictly between two floating-point numbers and is exactly representable by neither of them. A less common situation is that a real number is out of range, that is, its absolute value is larger than $\\beta \\times \\beta^{e_{max}}$ or smaller than $1.0 \\times \\beta^{e_{min}}$. Most of this lecture discusses issues due to the first reason. However, numbers that are out of range will be discussed in the sections Infinity and Denormalized Numbers."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  This section provides a tour of the IEEE standard. Each subsection discusses one aspect of the standard and why it was included. It is not the purpose of this paper to argue that the IEEE standard is the best possible floating-point standard but rather to accept the standard as given and provide an introduction to its use. For full details consult the standards themselves.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  There are several reasons why the base for floating point operations is commonly 2. The section on Relative Error and Ulps mentioned one reason: the results of error analyses are much tighter when $\\beta is 2$ because a rounding error of .5 ulp wobbles by a factor of $\\beta$ when computed as a relative error, and error analyses are almost always simpler when based on relative error. A related reason has to do with the effective precision for large bases. Consider $\\beta = 16$, $p = 1$ compared to $\\beta = 2$, $p = 4$. Both systems have 4 bits of significand. Consider the computation of 15/8. When $\\beta = 2$, 15 is represented as $1.111 \\times 2^{3}$, and 15/8 as $1.111 \\times 2^{0}$. So 15/8 is exact. However, when $\\beta = 16$, 15 is represented as $F \\times 16^{0}$, where $F$ is the hexadecimal digit for 15. But $15/8$ is represented as $1 \\times 16^{0}$, which has only one bit correct. In general, base 16 can lose up to 3 bits, so that a precision of $p$ hexadecimal digits can have an effective precision as low as $4p - 3$ rather than $4p$ binary bits. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of using \\beta = 2 is that there is a way to gain an extra bit of significance. Since floating-point numbers are always normalized, the most significant bit of the significand is always 1, and there is no reason to waste a bit of storage representing it. Formats that use this trick are said to have a hidden bit. It was already pointed out in <a href=\"ncg_goldberg.html#682\">Floating-point Formats</a> that this requires a special convention for 0. The method given there was that an exponent of e_{min} - 1 and a significand of all zeros represents 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  IEEE 754 single precision is encoded in 32 bits using 1 bit for the sign, 8 bits for the exponent, and 23 bits for the significand. However, it uses a hidden bit, so the significand is 24 bits (p = 24), even though it is encoded using only 23 bits."

By displaying only 10 of the 13 digits, the calculator appears to the user as a \"black box\" that computes exponentials, cosines, etc. to 10 digits of accuracy. For the calculator to compute functions like exp, log and cos to within 10 digits with reasonable efficiency, it needs a few extra digits to work with. It is not hard to find a simple rational expression that approximates log with an error of 500 units in the last place. Thus computing with 13 digits gives an answer correct to 10 digits. By keeping these extra 3 digits hidden, the calculator presents a simple model to the operator. </font>\n",

Two common methods of representing signed numbers are sign/magnitude and two's complement. Sign/magnitude is the system used for the sign of the significand in the IEEE formats: one bit is used to hold the sign, the rest of the bits represent the magnitude of the number. The two's complement representation is often used in integer arithmetic. In this scheme, a number in the range [-2<sup>p-1</sup>, 2<sup>p-1</sup> - 1] is represented by the smallest nonnegative number that is congruent to it modulo 2<sup>p</sup>. </font>\n",

What this means is that if $ \\overline{k}$ is the value of the exponent bits interpreted as an unsigned integer, then the exponent of the floating-point number is $ \\overline{k} -127$. This is often called the <em>unbiased exponent</em> to distinguish from the biased exponent $ \\overline{k}$. </font>\n",

The section <a href=\"ncg_goldberg.html#693\">Guard Digits</a> pointed out that computing the exact difference or sum of two floating-point numbers can be very expensive when their exponents are substantially different. That section introduced guard digits, which provide a practical way of computing differences while guaranteeing that the relative error is small. However, computing with a single guard digit will not always give the same answer as computing the exact result and then rounding. By introducing a second guard digit and a third <em>sticky</em> bit, differences can be computed at only a little more cost than with a single guard digit, but the result is the same as if the difference were computed exactly and then rounded [Goldberg 1990]. Thus the standard can be implemented efficiently. </font>\n",

When a program is moved between two machines and both support IEEE arithmetic, then if any intermediate result differs, it must be because of software bugs, not from differences in arithmetic. Another advantage of precise specification is that it makes it easier to reason about floating-point. Proofs about floating-point are hard enough, without having to deal with multiple cases arising from multiple kinds of arithmetic. Just as integer programs can be proven to be correct, so can floating-point programs, although what is proven in that case is that the rounding error of the result satisfies certain bounds. Theorem 4 is an example of such a proof. These proofs are made much easier when the operations being reasoned about are precisely specified. Once an algorithm is proven to be correct for IEEE arithmetic, it will work correctly on any machine supporting the IEEE standard. </font>\n",

However, it is easy to see why most zero finders require a domain. The zero finder does its work by probing the function <code>f</code> at various values. If it probed for a value outside the domain of <code>f</code>, the code for <code>f</code> might well compute 0/0, and the computation would halt, unnecessarily aborting the zero finding process. </font>\n",

Implementations are free to put system-dependent information into the significand. Thus there is not a unique NaN, but rather a whole family of NaNs. When a NaN and an ordinary floating-point number are combined, the result should be the same as the NaN operand. Thus if the result of a long computation is a NaN, the system-dependent information in the significand will be the information that was generated when the first NaN in the computation was generated. Actually, there is a caveat to the last statement. If both operands are NaNs, then the result will be one of those NaNs, but it might not be the NaN that was generated first. </font>\n",

This is much safer than simply returning the largest representable number. As an example, consider computing $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, when $\\beta =10, p=3$ and $e_{max} =98$. If $x=3 \\times 10^70$ and $y=4 \\times 10^70$, then $x^2$ will overflow, and be replaced by $9.99 \\times 10^98$. Similarly $y^2$, and $x^2 + y^2$ will each overflow in turn, and be replaced by $9.99 \\times 10^98$. So the final result will be $0.5 \\times 9.99 \\times 10^98 = 3.16 \\times 10^49$, which is drastically wrong: the correct answer is $5 \\times 10^{70}$. In IEEE arithmetic, the result of $x^2$ is $\\inf$, as is $y^2$, $x^2 + y^2$ and $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the final result is $\\inf$, which is safer than returning an ordinary floating-point number that is nowhere near the correct answer.<a href=\"#920\"><sup>17</sup></a></font>\n",

A nonzero number divided by 0, however, returns infinity: $1/0$ = $\\inf$, -1/0 = $-\\inf$. The reason for the distinction is this: if $f(x) \\rightarrow 0$ and $g(x) \\rightarrow 0$ as $x$ approaches some limit, then $f(x)/g(x)$ could have any value. For example, when $f(x) = sin(x)$ and $g(x) = x$, then $f(x)/g(x) \\rightarrow 1$ as $ x \\rightarrow 0$. But when $f(x)=1 - cos(x), f(x)/g(x) \\rightarrow 0$. When thinking of $0/0$ as the limiting situation of a quotient of two very small numbers, $0/0$ could represent anything. Thus in the IEEE standard, $0/0$ results in a NaN. But when $ c \\gt 0$, $f(x) \\rightarrow c $, $g(x) \\rightarrow 0$, then $f(x)/g(x) \\rightarrow \\pm \\inf $, for any analytic functions $f$ and $g$. If $ g(x) \\lt 0$ for small $x$, then $f(x)/g(x)  \\rightarrow - \\inf $, otherwise the limit is $+ \\inf$. So the IEEE standard defines $c/0 = \\pm \\inf$, as long as $ c \\neq 0$. The sign of $\\inf$ depends on the signs of $ c$ and $0$ in the usual way, so that $-10/0 = - \\inf$, and $-10/-0 = + \\inf$. </font>\n",

In the case of $\\pm \\inf$, however, the value of the expression might be an ordinary floating-point number because of rules like $1/ \\inf = 0$. Here is a practical example that makes use of the rules for infinity arithmetic. Consider computing the function $x/(x^2/x^2+1)$. This is a bad formula, because not only will it overflow when $x$ is larger than $\\sqrt{\\beta}\\beta^{e_{max}/2}$, but infinity arithmetic will give the wrong answer because it will yield $0$, rather than a number near $1/x$. However, $x/x^2 + 1)$ can be rewritten as $1/(x + x^{-1})$. This improved expression will not overflow prematurely and because of infinity arithmetic will have the correct value when $x =0: 1/(0 + 0^{-1}) = 1/(0 + \\inf) = 1/\\inf = 0$. Without infinity arithmetic, the expression $1/(x + x^{-1})$ requires a test for $x = 0$, which not only adds extra instructions, but may also disrupt a pipeline. This example illustrates a general fact, namely that infinity arithmetic often avoids the need for special case checking; however, formulas need to be carefully inspected to make sure they do not have spurious behavior at infinity (as $x/(x^2+1)$ did). </font>\n",

If a distinction were made when comparing +0 and -0, simple tests like <code>if</code>&nbsp;<code>(x</code>&nbsp;<code>=</code>&nbsp;<code>0)</code> would have very unpredictable behavior, depending on the sign of <code>x</code>. Thus the IEEE standard defines comparison so that +0 = -0, rather than -0 &lt; +0. Although it would be possible always to ignore the sign of zero, the IEEE standard does not do so. When a multiplication or division involves a signed zero, the usual sign rules apply in computing the sign of the answer. Thus 3<font  face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">&#183;</font>(+0) = +0, and +0/-3 = -0. If zero did not have a sign, then the relation 1/(1/<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica\"><em>x</em></font>) = <font face=\"Arial,Helvetica\"><em>x</em></font> would fail to hold when <em>x</em> =inf. The reason is that 1/-inf and 1/+inf both result in 0, and 1/0 results in +inf, the sign information having been lost. One way to restore the identity 1/(1/<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica\"><em>x</em></font>) = <font face=\"Arial,Helvetica\"><em>x</em></font> is to only have one kind of infinity, however that would result in the disastrous consequence of losing the sign of an overflowed quantity. </font>\n",
