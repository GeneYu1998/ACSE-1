    "\n",
    "## Introducing the Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the cloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Azure.png](attachment:Azure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple related definitions, e.g. Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> _from the cloud computing article_\n",
    "\n",
    "or from Microsoft:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services – including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and intelligence – over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale. Typically, you only pay for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, \"the Cloud\" is a set of networked computer resources accessed remotely over a wide area network such as the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Cloud vs. Private Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Public Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Public Cloud, _services_ are bought (often Pay As You Go) on a need basis, with infrastructure shared with other users (often on a per machine basis)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple providers:\n",
    "    - Microsoft Azure\n",
    "    - Amazon AWS\n",
    "    - Google Cloud Services\n",
    "    - Alibaba Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Private Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "For a Private Cloud system, the full _infrastructure_ (i.e. computer equipment at the data centre level) is purchased, and then run (or subcontracted) by the company or organization in question, and then accessed over a network (the network itself may be public, so via the internet, or private). This gives full control over hardware, policy and configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example, the college [HPC clusters](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/support/getting-started/) (aka CX1 &CX2) provide multi-machine compute systems to Imperial researchers, based out of a data centre in Slough, to the west of London.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hybrid Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "In a hybrid cloud situation an organization run a private cloud on their own data centre, but purchases additional public cloud services as needed. In principle, this allows the organization to combine the control and intellectual property advantages of private cloud with the availability and scalability advantages of the public cloud. In practice this can sometimes lead to duplication of effort, or attempts to replicate unsuitable policies from the private cloud service into the public cloud part.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use the cloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Availability - systems tend to be online and supported 24/7 \n",
    "- Scalability - Increasing/decreasing your allocation tends to happen instantly (or as soon as your credit card bill allows)\n",
    "- Reach - Systems are accessible from most of the world via internet\n",
    "- Agility - rapidly develop, test & deploy software\n",
    "- Disaster Mitigation - Usually offer backups/rollbacks, sometimes at extra cost. Note that this doesn't prevent users needing to check that what's backed up is what was intended.\n",
    "- Fault Tolerance - Cloud systems usually fallback to alternatives in case of physical failures.\n",
    "- Elasticity - Systems can react dynamically to increasing or decreasing demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why not to use the cloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Latancy issues - Keep large bandwidth data transfers local to each other.\n",
    "- Costs (Data transfer, machine hire, etc.)\n",
    "- Security - You are handing your data to someone else.\n",
    "- Control - If you need personal oversight.\n",
    "- Intellectual property concerns - some data may have legal or contractual constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Infrastructure, Platform and Software as a Service\n",
    "\n",
    "\"As a service\" can be treated the same as \"available to rent\". Just as the difference between renting a hire car versus hailing a taxi, the different levels of service imply different levels of responsibility and control. We can list the three most typical types here. Note that precisely where in this hierarchy a specific service can be difficult, particularly when services are parcelled up and resold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Infrastructure As A Service is the most basic model for using the Cloud. You purchase time on an entire computer (usually actually a virtual machine, i.e. a portion of a large server), then set up the entire system from scratch, just as you would with a computer under your desk.\n",
    "\n",
    "IASS gives you maximum control of your environment (you can do virtually anything you like within the constraints of your cloud provider's security policies). However this also means you have considerable responsibilities (applying updates, scaling machine sizes, etc), and may be paying more than you would for other models, particularly if you have severely overestimated your system requirements *or leave machines running but unused*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Platform As A Service (PaaS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Platform as a service further abstracts away the concepts of hardware and environment so that you can concentrate on writing the code which actually does the job that you want to do. The provider configures the core operating system and programming environment, with you just writing the actual application code. An example would be a service such as www.mybinder.org or Google Colab, which provides Jupyter instances to work in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software As A Service (SaaS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Software As A Service is the cloud model with the lowest barrier to entry. The provider supplies both the infrastructure and the application software, allowing you to concentrate purely on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Pizza model \n",
    "\n",
    "We can illustrate the differences by considering an alternative industry, that of pizza:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pizza as a service\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is in charge of providing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "||Local on premises (homemade)|IaaS (store bought)|PaaS (takeaway)|SaaS (restaurant)|\n",
    "|-|:---:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n",

    "## Accessing Azure Cloud Services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting an Azure account\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Azure provides a number of different kinds of accounts and subscription methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Free accounts \n",
    "- Promotional subscriptions\n",
    "- Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions\n",
    "- Enterprise subscriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Most relevant for this course is the Azure Student subscription, which allows users from authorized educational institutions (such as Imperial College) to register each year for $100 of free credit and (slightly limited) access to all Azure services. Activation is via your college email address, to which your account will be linked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) is the (desktop) point of interaction with Azure services on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logging into the Portal\n",
    "\n",
    "You automatically have access to the Azure portal via your college login id (in the form `abc120@ic.ac.uk`) and password. In fact, Imperial College delegate their system authentication to Azure Active Directory, a Microsoft Azure Cloud service for authentication and authorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once logged in you can sign up for your student subscription on this [page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/overview). This will give you 100 US dollars  of virtual money to spend on Microsoft Cloud services. Note that 100 dollar can last a very long time if used carefully, but can rapidly run out if you are wasteful. Always be sure to shut down machines that you are no longer using, and to clean up after yourself."

    "## Virtualization & Containerization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compatibility layers/Emulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before considering full virtualization, there are compatibility layers (such as the Windows Subsystem for Linux version 1, WSL1, which allows linux problems to run on windows, or WINE, which does the reversee). Very similar are the various translation layers released for Mac OS X during hardware transitions, from powerPC to Intel chips and from 32 to 64 bit software. It is likely that similar software exists as Apple transition from Intel to ARM/Nvidea chips in ther latest range.\n",
    "\n",
    " These software layers act at the level of application, which allows software created for one operating system to run on another operating system by translating commands intended for one interface into commands intended for another. Very similar is emulation, in which software is created to play the part of hardware not physically present in the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virtual Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Servers in data centres are often designed to maximize the number of processor cores available on every motherboard, with multiple CPU sockets and high core counts on the individual dies. However the number of cores users actually need varies, often as low as 1 core for simple, low priority serial tasks. Virtualization allows Cloud providers to portion out the cores of a particular server board between multiple users, with each of them experiencing behaviour as if they had access to an entire machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, virtualization is fairly simple: Computer software has developed in layers, which communicate with each other via standard interfaces. This allows equipment from multiple manufacturers to work together. In a physical computer the hardware & firmware (e.g. the BIOS) sit below the operating system. In a virtual machine a second operating system sits above a software layer running on the host operating which provides an interrface to some of the underlying hardware, typically only a subset of the real hardware available to it. \n",

    "##### Why use Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost everything we've shown here could be done inside inside a `venv` virtual environment, instead of via Docker. The biggest difference is that Docker controls the entire software stack, including linux distribution, package versions and the command to be run (which isn't limited to Python). Moreover Docker images can be uploaded to repositories such as Dockerhub. This makes docker ideal for distributing reproducible \"app\" style versions of software which are (virtually) guaranteed to work, regardless of the end users' environment. This also makes it ideal for distributions of software to cloud services. The Dockerfile can be transferred and built on the remote system, with confidence the final output will be what was intended.\n",
