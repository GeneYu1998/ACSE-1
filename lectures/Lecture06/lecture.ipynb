    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### By the end of this lecture you should:\n",
    " - Understand the basic concepts of HTTP communication and RESTful APIs.\n",
    " - Be able to code a simple app in Flask.\n",
    " - Be able to serve that app from Azure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Azure Web services & Web Apps\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key questions with cloud services is which protocol to use to access them. For Azure services their are three major options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), to access Windows (and some linux) virtual machines and to use them in the same manner as a desktop.\n",
    "- Secure Shell (SSH), to access a terminal on VMs (or apps on linux through X forwarding)\n",
    "- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) to access services via the web, whether through a browser, or another application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look further how that can work:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### RDP\n",
    "\n",
    "RDP should be familar, either from your time with an Azure lab, or from the exercises yesterday. This allows a user to connect to a GUI on remote machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### SSH\n",
    "\n",
    "SSH (the secure shell) should again be familiar to most of you from the exercises yesterday.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP/HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP & HTTPS (i.e secure HTTP) addresses will be familiar to you from your experience on the web. They are an example of a uniform resource locator (url), which take the form\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://user:password@www.imperial.ac.uk:8000/example/example/example.html?val1=abc&val2=123.4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This address can be broken down into several sections\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The leftmost part defines the protocol (think of it as an agreed language) being used. With HTTPS encryption must be agreed between the user agent (e.g. the browser) and the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not frequently used with HTTP (due to relative lack of security in that service) but usernames and passwords can be provided in the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Server\n",
    "\n",
    "The server provides a human readable mnemonic for the IP address of the remote server being connected to. This is looked up, working from right to left by contacting helper \"name servers\" (aka DNS servers) to find the machine you request (so in this case, a global server will be contacted to find a `.uk` DNS server, which points us at the `.imperial` server, which points us at the webserver dealing with requests to `www`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Port number\n",
    "\n",
    "Ports can be thought of as individual communication addresses on a single machine. Only one type of communication can happen on one port at a one time, although multiple users can be served. Some protocols have standard ports which they default to if no specific port number is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### End point\n",
    "\n",
    "The portion from the end of the server name to the beginning of the parameters is passed to the remote application connected to the port to decide what response to give. For a simple static http server this might be a directory path to a specific file. For a dynamic server, this might be a more complicated incantation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The text beyond the `?` consists of a set of parameters, encoded in a `key=value` format, which is again passed on to the server application to control its output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RESTful APIs \n",

    "The UK and the EU countries have all passed similar data protection law, normally called the General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)) which protects the personal data of those living in the European Economic Area. The law allows individuals to access and correct their identifiable personal data when stored in easily searchable forms such as on computer. It also places constraints on the forms this information should be stored in, whether they can transfer outside the EEA and the rules over who can access them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also computational science is less affected than, for example, medicine, it is still possible that they (or their successor regulations) will one day apply to you. Although the core Articles are relatively complex they boil down to the idea that identifable personal information (individual records linked names, addresses, phone numbers etc, or to personal descriptions) should only be kept for as long as strictly necessary, and only be accessible by those that need to access it for the reason it was originally collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals have the right to request a copy of the records held on them by companies (or other bodies engaged in \"economic activity\"), and to correct any wrong information which is being stored. \n",

    "## Additional Services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "[Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/introducing-azure-functions/) is a service which allows a Python function to be accessed directly from the web via parameters passed through a URL. An example will be shown in the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure has several systems available to store data, depending on its format. This might be unstructured binary data, structured databases or something in between\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blob Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "To quote Microsoft, [blob storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) is designed to hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Serving images or documents directly to a browser.\n",
    "  - Storing files for distributed access.\n",
    "  - Streaming video and audio.\n",
    "  - Writing to log files.\n",
    "  - Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.\n",
    "  - Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is accessed via a network interface, with charges depending on how frequent access is expected to be and the volume of data transferred. In general a URL is assigned to each item, which can be used in multiple ways, including those listed above, to access the blob object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure provides a number of ways to access data in databases. Most of them are built around the [SQL database language](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/sql-commands). SQL, which dates back to 1974, follows a hierarchical approach, with a database server holding databases, each of which can hold multiple tables holding records each of which has multiple values in multiple columns. A useful mental reference is to multiple spreadsheet files (e.g. Excel) each containing multiple sheets with rows with data in multiple columns. However as so often with scriptable text interfaces, access is more powerful, although difficult for newcomers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with inbuilt support for SQL in SQLite format, in which individual databases are stored in local files, via the builtin package `sqlite3`. To use a full fat SQL server on Azure appropriate additional software should be downloaded [e.g the MySql connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/connect-python). However the basic syntax to connect to, read and update individual databases remains similar."
